# Kevin Moore's Super-Awesome Personal README

🌴 I am a Florida-based developer, writer, and activist.  I typically work on a contract/freelance basis.  I am always interested in hearing about people's newest projects, espcially ones designed for large-sized impact.

## 🏷 Preferred name

Kevin, but I will also answer to most nicknames that heavily make use of the letter K, e.g. "K-One" or "K-Copter" or "Special K". I have always wanted a cool nickname like Sea Bass or Big Tough, but this has not naturally materialized yet.

##  👨🏻 Preferred pronouns

he/him, but I do not feel strongly about this. 

## 💌 Feedback delivery 

Direct & ASAP. Raise issues, and we will resolve them (probably...). I almost never work with people I don't want to work with, so I generally feel confident that growth/resolution/improvement (in all kinds of ways) can come from constructive feedback.

## ☕️ What energives me

Improving the lives of other people.

Laughter. Please feel free to make jokes around me. Even if I don't laugh, I'm likely to be amused by the effort!

## 📣 Quotes I like
