# Kevin Moore's Super-Awesome Personal README

üå¥ I am a Florida-based developer, writer, and activist/organizer.  I typically work on a contract/freelance basis.  I am always interested in hearing about people's newest projects, espcially ones designed for large-sized impact. I have a law degree and once worked as a lawyer, but no longer have a license (by choice!). I still use my legal skills for various projects, though.

## üè∑ Preferred name

Kevin, but I will also answer to most nicknames that heavily make use of the letter K, e.g. "K-One" or "K-Copter" or "Special K". I have always wanted a cool nickname like Sea Bass or Big Tough ("BT"), but this has not naturally materialized yet.

##  üë®üèª Preferred pronouns

he/him, but I do not feel strongly about this. 

## üíå Feedback delivery 

Directly, politely, and ASAP. Raise issues, and we will resolve them (probably...). I almost never work with people I don't want to work with, so I generally feel confident that growth/resolution/improvement (in all kinds of ways) can come from constructive feedback. 

Professionalism is a quality I strive for. If we're both being professional, it should be fine. We are in this together!

## ‚òïÔ∏è What energives me

Improving the lives of other people.

Laughter. Please feel free to make jokes around me. Even if I don't laugh, I'm likely to be amused by the effort!

Learning new things. I think one of the main reasons many people don't grow much past high school is because they stop learning new stuff. The idea of not growing terrifies me, so I'm constantly trying to pick up new skills or tossing my hats into fairly different arenas.

Good teammates. Never underestimate the power of being surrounded by highly-motivated people.

## Comics I've Published

One of the cooler things I've done the last few years is authoring some comics with @teenyrobots. So far, my published work has largely revolved around the them of Debt in America, but I would like to expand to writing some other economics-themes comics.
